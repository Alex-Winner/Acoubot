## Project Overview
Acoubot is an autonomous robotic system engineered to evaluate and improve classroom acoustics. This initiative is an amalgamation of theoretical knowledge and practical engineering, addressing real-world issues that hinder effective teaching and learning due to subpar acoustic conditions. The project encapsulates a full spectrum of technical exploration, from acoustic theory to robotics and sensor technology, resulting in a solution that offers both analysis and actionable recommendations for acoustic enhancements.

## Technical Scope

The project spans various domains, including:

* Acoustic Measurement: Utilizing an array of sensors to assess reverberation time, background noise levels, and sound insulation between rooms.
* Robotics Engineering: Featuring a mobile unit with LIDAR and ultrasonic sensors, and a Raspberry Pi 4b controller, all integrated within a 3D-printed robot body.
* Software Development: From sensor reading and signal processing to navigation and user interface design, all tailored to optimize the acoustic environment.

## Content Highlights

The project is comprehensively documented, covering:

* System Overview: Outlining the purpose, scope, and definitions.
* Theoretical and Technological Background: Surveying problems and solutions from both theoretical and technological standpoints, including discussions on sensors, actuators, and embedded systems.
* Functionality Specifications: Detailing the macro system diagram and the interplay between mobile and stationary units.
* Hardware and Software Architecture: Explaining the block diagrams, controller specifications, and algorithmic improvements.
* Design and Validation: Showcasing the 3D design of the robot and the extensive testing program.
* Operating Instructions and Summary: Providing guidance for users and a recapitulation of the project's achievements.
